        <h2 id="learningP2">Who are we?</h2>
        <p id="learningP2">LearningMe Was made by 3 Computational Systems Engineers students. The idea was born as the same experience that they, as many teenagers, are living as students. These Students are, Gabriel Trujillo Gomez, original from the state of Michoacán; Itzel Yazmin Cordero Sanchez from Sinaloa and Mark Octavio Rivera Acosta from Chihuahua, all of them from Mexico. This three students have very different ideas, but together they make a great dynamic team, distributing the tasks between each other in a way that everyone makes a significantly job contributing for the project. This is who they are and how they work.<br><br>
