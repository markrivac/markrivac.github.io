          <h2>What is it?</h2>
          <p>Students do not like to study. This can be for different types of learning, because they are well organized, they can not find a practical way to study or simply because they do not like it. But the main problem is that everyone has their own type of learning, and not knowing your kind of learning, studying becomes more difficult, tedious and boring, and you are not learning the right way. All this is worrying as it is reflected in the education of our country, and that is why we want to give a solution.</p>

        <h2 id="learningP2">Who are we?</h2>
        <p id="learningP2">LearningMe Was made by 3 Computational Systems Engineers students. The idea was born as the same experience that they, as many teenagers, are living as students. These Students are, Gabriel Trujillo Gomez, original from the state of Michoacán; Itzel Yazmin Cordero Sanchez from Sinaloa and Mark Octavio Rivera Acosta from Chihuahua, all of them from Mexico. This three students have very different ideas, but together they make a great dynamic team, distributing the tasks between each other in a way that everyone makes a significantly job contributing for the project. This is who they are and how they work.<br><br>
